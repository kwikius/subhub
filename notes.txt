5 channels of dma

use DMA for USART transmit ( USART1_TX channel / USART2_TX gps rc frsky etc)
// but not receive since parsing of input packets is reqd I think atm
Technically the id could be used to predicate packet length but may cause problems
if an invalid packet is received. Cant really use it till it has ben validated

i2c can use DMA since all data lengths are known in advance

Potential dma

i2c
adc

Peripheral    dma channel
--------------------------
ADC        |    1
I2C1_TX    |    2 
I2C1_RX    |    3
USART1_TX  |    4
USART1_RX  |    5

decided on a format for init of libs, naming etc
each lib has a static function  either called init or setup
Which to use?
Wheteher o have a deinit 

use RTOS or not
Whether to filter a2d results using a LP filter
Use DMA for A2D?

Message passing protocol

Most important goal is low latency
3 parts to latency
1 serialisation
2 transport
3 deserialisation
------------------
look at Capnproto

Mavlink1 fixed length of 17 bytes
   framing byte ;    // 0xFE not needed with COBS
   message length;   // 9 ? // not necessary. Can be done per message
   sequence number;  // not needed if packet is variable size
   system id;        // not needed for point to point link
   component id;     // not needed for point to point link
   message id   ;    // 1 byte is not sufficient 
   9 bytes payload ; // Inflexible
   2 bytes checksum ; // Can specify checksum per message. Some messages dont need checksum

link message format Variable message length of up to 255 bytes
max length message takes 2.55 ms to transmit.
Ideally messages are shorter during running.
Longer messages cab sent during initialisation
Messages should be restricted to some lengt for latency guarantees
Parsing time of messages

  Messages are framed with cobs. What time to encapsulate
  // Can encoding be combined with checksum/crc? impl really
  Each message has an id of 2 bytes giving 65536
  Add an 8 bit flags byte
