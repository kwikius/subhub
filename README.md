Subhub node software for a flight controller "subhub"

For a reasonable sized conventional model plane, it is difficult to make use of the wings for 
electronics if they need to come apart. By embedding a "subhub" in each wing of the plane, 
which communicates with the fuselage mounted  flight controller by means of a high speed 
serial link, sensors and servos can be placed in the wings with only one simple 4 way 
connector which provides power and full duplex serial signalling.
