Subhub node software for a simple distributed network version of Ardupilot flight controller.

For a reasonable sized conventional plane, it is difficult to make use of the wings for 
electronics if they need to come apart.
By embedding a "subhub" in each wing of the plane, which communicates with the fueslage mounted 
flight controller by means of a high speed speed serial link, sensors and servos can be placed 
in the wings with only one simple 4 way connector which provides power and full duplex serial
signalling.
